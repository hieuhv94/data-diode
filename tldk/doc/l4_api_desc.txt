Introduction
------------

This file contains a brief description of public API
for L4 packet procesing library (UDP and TCP).
The intention is to keep configuration API (context creation/deletion,
add/delete device, etc.) common for all L4 protocols supported.
BackEnd (BE) datapath and FrontEnd (FE) APIs differs,
but whenever possible similar syntax (and semantics) is preserved. 

1. tle_ctx.h
------------

/**
 * <tle_ctx>  - each such ctx represents an 'independent copy of the stack'.
 * It owns set of <stream>s and <dev>s entities and provides
 * (de)multiplexing input/output packets from/into devices into/from streams.
 * <dev> is an abstraction for the underlying device, that is able
 * to RX/TX packets and may provide some HW offload capabilities.
 * It is a user responsibility to add to the <ctx> all <dev>s,
 * that context has to manage, before starting to do stream operations
 * (open/send/recv,close) over that context.
 * Right now adding/deleting <dev>s to the context with open
 * streams is not supported.
 * <stream> represents an L4(UDP/TCP, etc.) endpoint <addr, port> and
 * is an analogy to socket entity.
 * As with a socket, there are ability to do recv/send over it.
 * <stream> belongs to particular <ctx> but is visible globally across
 * the process, i.e. any thread within the process can do recv/send over it
 * without any further synchronisation.
 * While 'upper' layer API is thread safe, lower layer API (rx_bulk/tx_bulk)
 * is not thread safe and is not supposed to be run on multiple threads
 * in parallel.
 * So single thread can drive multiple <ctx>s and do IO for them,
 * but multiple threads can't drive same <ctx> without some
 * explicit synchronization.

 * (part of send buffer became free again).

 * held on that stream. So it is not permitted to call stream_close()
 * within the callback function. Doing that would cause a deadlock.
 * While it is allowed to call stream send/recv functions within the
 * callback, it is not recommended: callback function will be invoked
 * within tle_udp_rx_bulk/tle_udp_tx_bulk context and some heavy processing
 * within the callback functions might cause performance degradation
 * or even loss of packets for further streams.
 * b) recv/send event.

 * receive event will be raised by either

 * remaining packets inside stream receive buffer.
 * send event will be raised by either
 * tle_udp_tx_burst() or tle_udp_stream_send() as long as there are any
 * free space inside stream send buffer.
 * Note that callback and event are mutually exclusive on <stream, op> basis.
 * It is not possible to  open a stream with both recv event and callback

 * by tle_udp_tx_bulk().
 * If *dst_addr* is NULL, then default remote address associated with that
 * stream (if any) will be used.
 * The main purpose of that function is to determine over which UDP dev
 * given packets have to be sent out and do necessary preparations for that.
 * Based on the *dst_addr* it does route lookup, fills L2/L3/L4 headers,
 * and, if necessary, fragments packets.
 * Depending on the underlying device information, it either does
 * IP/UDP checksum calculations in SW or sets mbuf TX checksum
 * offload fields properly.
 * For each input mbuf the following conditions have to be met:
 *	- data_off point to the start of packet's UDP data.
 *	- there is enough header space to prepend L2/L3/L4 headers.
 * @param s
 *   UDP stream to send packets over.
 * @param pkt
 *   The burst of output packets that need to be send.
 * @param num
 *   Number of elements in the *pkt* array.
 * @param dst_addr
 *   Destination address to send packets to.
 * @return
 *   number of packets successfully queued in the stream send buffer.
